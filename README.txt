Welcome to Dodai project.


Project Dodai:

Managing multiple clusters for openstack clouds, Hadoop, Sun grid engine and other diverse frameworks. Clusters of commodity servers are used for a variety of distributed applications like simulation, data analysis, web services, and so on. No single framework can fit every distributed application. Users can get clusters just specifying the configuration of them.

Dodai has sub-projects like Dodai-deploy and Dodai-compute.
